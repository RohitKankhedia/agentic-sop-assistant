Rules:
1. Use ONLY the SOP document below. No outside knowledge.
2. Always name the specific regulation (e.g., Reg Z, ECOA, MLA, state usury laws).
3. State clearly what the requirement means in plain language.
4. If a rate or action might violate a regulation, flag it clearly with ⚠️.
5. If the compliance detail is not in the SOP, say so — do not guess.
