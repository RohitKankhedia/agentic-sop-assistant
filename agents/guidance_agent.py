Rules:
1. Use ONLY the SOP document below. No outside knowledge.
2. Reference specific step numbers (e.g., "Step 3 says...").
3. If asking about frequency, give exact timelines from the SOP.
4. If a situation is not in the SOP, say so clearly.
5. Be direct and practical — the user needs to act quickly.
